Feel the charm of Python! Let us love python together!

Python, being a well-designed high-level programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. It also be known for “built-in batteries” because of its various and rich standard libraries and built-in functions. 

Why not study it? l will try to make you feel the charm of python from the bottom of your heart.

## simple

First, let us start with the classic example - HelloWorld. In python, Hello World is like this:

```python
print("Hello,World!")
```
One line. And in Java:
```Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String []args) {
       System.out.println("Hello,World!");
    }
}
```
5 lines. In C programming language:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("Hello,World!\n");  
   return 0;
}
```
5 lines, the same as Java. If this is not enough for you to believe python, another example below:

The question asks you to use a string character for string concat.

Such as, an array like this: “Hello”, “World”. The join method should return “Hello World”. In Java, we don’t have a method Java has written for us:
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
public class Join {
    public static String join(String join,String[] strAry){
        StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
        for(int i=0;i<strAry.length;i++){
             if(i==(strAry.length-1)){
                 sb.append(strAry[i]);
             }else{
                 sb.append(strAry[i]).append(join);
             }
        }
		return new String(sb);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args){
        String[] sa={"Hello", "World"};
        String a=join(" ",sa);
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```
But in python. Python team has writen the method join for us:
```python
a = ["Hello", "World"]
print(" ".join(a))
```
The line numbers is very different. As we all see, python is more simple than java. That’s why it has “built-in batteries”.
